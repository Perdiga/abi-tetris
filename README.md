# ABI Trainer

Project scaffold for the ABI Trainer inventory-packing game.

## Source of truth

The locked implementation plan lives in `docs/design/game-design.md`.

## Getting started

### Option A: VS Code Dev Container

1. Install Docker Desktop and the VS Code **Dev Containers** extension.
2. Open this folder in VS Code.
3. Run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** when prompted (or from the Command Palette).
4. Wait for the container to build and for `npm install` to finish automatically.
5. Run the existing scripts in the VS Code terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```

The Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and is forwarded automatically by the container.

## Deployment

The repository includes GitHub Actions CI and automatic deployment to an OCI
Always Free Object Storage static website. See
[the OCI deployment guide](docs/deployment-oci-always-free.md) to create the
bucket and configure the required GitHub secrets.

### Option B: Local Node.js

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
npm run lint
```
